	/*Git reset is opposite of git add
	 * Git checkout the branches, to revert the changes
	 * Git pull=git fetch, git merge
	 * Merge conflicts: git pull then make the choice then git push to update
	 * Commits are like a DAG
	 * Head is where the current commit is(where the local master is)
	 * Push makes the new version as the new first node and then moves the head tag
	 * Git never stores entire copy of the file.
	 * Stores differences between commits each time
	 * You are always local
	 * Reverting the commit: takes the difference applied then reverse it
	 * Branching while keeping the master clean
	 * Master is the hub of all the good code
	 * Get a merge conflict when you merge the branches
	 * So make a new commit that is the final result of the commit
	 * Git push (does the origin)
	 * Git branch <file name>
	 * Git checkout <file name> means go into that branch
	 * Git status shows that all the changes that you've done to the branch
	 * Git checkout master goes back to the master branch
	 * Git merge: go to the master, then git merge <file name> <- particular branch
	 * Rebase combines two branches.
	 * Checkout moves a head to the reference
	 * Cherry pick selects a particular commit to put into the front position
	 * Git rebase: moves the entire branch at the front
	 * Hook runs a script or does some stuff
	 * Touch creates a simple file
	 * Git revert=bunch of git cherry-pick
	 * Git pull before make changes then save
	 * Git rebase linearize the git lol
	 *
